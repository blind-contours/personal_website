I'm a PhD candidate in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of
California, Berkeley under the supervision of [Alan Hubbard](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/alan-hubbard/) and [Martyn Smith](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/martyn-smith/). My work revolves around developing assumption-lean methods for the statistical analysis of
mixed exposure data. That is, in most realistic exposure settings humans are exposed to a mixture of chemicals which modify biological pathways which lead to disease states. I develop statistical methods to understand what parts of a mixed exposure cause disease and through which pathways. I collaborate with epidemiologists, biologists, and medical doctors to develop sound statistical approaches to answer real world problems.

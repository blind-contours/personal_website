abstract: "Nuclear receptors (NRs) are important biological targets of
  endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Identifying chemicals that can act as
  EDCs and modulate the function of NRs is difficult because of the time and
  cost of in vitro and in vivo screening to determine the potential hazards of
  the 100 000s of chemicals that humans are exposed to. Hence, there is a need
  for computational approaches to prioritize chemicals for biological testing.
  Machine learning (ML) techniques are alternative methods that can quickly
  screen millions of chemicals and identify those that may be an EDC.
  Computational models of chemical binding to multiple NRs have begun to emerge.
  Recently, a Nuclear Receptor Activity (NuRA) dataset, describing
  experimentally derived small-molecule activity against various NRs has been
  created. "

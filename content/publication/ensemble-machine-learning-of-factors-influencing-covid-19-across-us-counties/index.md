abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the
  causal agent for COVID-19, is a communicable disease spread through close
  contact. It is known to disproportionately impact certain communities due to
  both biological susceptibility and inequitable exposure. In this study, we
  investigate the most important health, social, and environmental factors
  impacting the early phases (before July, 2020) of per capita COVID-19
  transmission and per capita all-cause mortality in US counties. We aggregate
  county-level physical and mental health, environmental pollution, access to
  health care, demographic characteristics, vulnerable population scores, and
  other epidemiological data to create a large feature set to analyze per capita
  COVID-19 outcomes. Because of the high-dimensionality, multicollinearity, and
  unknown interactions of the data, we use ensemble machine learning and
  marginal prediction methods to identify the most salient factors associated
  with several COVID-19 outbreak measure. Our variable importance results show
  that measures of ethnicity, public transportation and preventable diseases are
  the strongest predictors for both per capita COVID-19 incidence and mortality.
  Specifically, the CDC measures for minority populations, CDC measures for
  limited English, and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals
  in a county were the most important features for per capita COVID-19 cases
  within a month after the pandemic started in a county and also at the latest
  date examined. For per capita all-cause mortality at day 100 and total to
  date, we find that public transportation use and proportion of Black- and/or
  African-American individuals in a county are the strongest predictors. The
  methods predict that, keeping all other factors fixed, a 10% increase in
  public transportation use, all other factors remaining fixed at the observed
  values, is associated with increases mortality at day 100 of 2012 individuals
  (95% CI [1972, 2356]) and likewise a 10% increase in the proportion of Black-
  and/or African-American individuals in a county is associated with increases
  total deaths at end of study of 2067 (95% CI [1189, 2654]). Using data until
  the end of study, the same metric suggests ethnicity has double the
  association as the next most important factors, which are location, disease
  prevalence, and transit factors. Our findings shed light on societal patterns
  that have been reported and experienced in the U.S. by using robust methods to
  understand the features most responsible for transmission and sectors of
  society most vulnerable to infection and mortality. In particular, our results
  provide evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
  minority populations. Our results suggest that mitigation measures, including
  how vaccines are distributed, could have the greatest impact if they are given
  with priority to the highest risk communities.

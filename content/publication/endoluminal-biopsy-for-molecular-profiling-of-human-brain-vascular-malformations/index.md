abstract: Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling abnormalities
  occur in most brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). No means exist to
  molecularly profile bAVMs without open surgery, limiting precision medicine
  approaches to treatment. Here, we report use of endoluminal biopsy of the
  vessel lumen of bAVMs to characterize gene expression and blood flow–mediated
  transcriptional changes in living patients.

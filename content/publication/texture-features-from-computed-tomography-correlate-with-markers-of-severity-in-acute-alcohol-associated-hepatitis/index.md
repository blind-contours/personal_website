  The aim of this study was to use texture analysis to establish quantitative
  CT-based imaging features to predict clinical severity in patients with acute
  alcohol-associated hepatitis (AAH). A secondary aim was to compare the
  performance of texture analysis to deep learning. In this study, mathematical
  texture features were extracted from CT slices of the liver for 34 patients
  with a diagnosis of AAH and 35 control patients. Recursive feature elimination
  using random forest (RFE-RF) was used to identify the best combination of
  features to distinguish AAH from controls. These features were subsequently
  used as predictors to determine associated clinical values. To compare machine
  learning with deep learning approaches, a 2D dense convolutional neural
  network (CNN) was implemented and trained for the classification task of AAH.
  RFE-RF identified 23 top features used to classify AAH images, and the
  subsequent model demonstrated an accuracy of 82.4% in the test set. The deep
  learning CNN demonstrated an accuracy of 70% in the test set. We show that
  texture features of the liver are unique in AAH and are candidate quantitative
  biomarkers that can be used in prospective studies to predict the severity and
  outcomes of patients with AAH.
